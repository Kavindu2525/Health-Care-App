About The Project:
                    This project is about creating a key feature for a healthcare app using Java and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). 
                    The main focus is on managing doctor availability, where doctors can enter their available dates, and the system sets their working hours from 5 pm to 10 pm by default. The app allows for two types of appointments: general and referral, with referral appointments requiring extra information from the referring doctor.
                    Appointments are scheduled in one-hour slots, and the system automatically adjusts the time based on how many slots are booked.
                    Patients can choose a doctor, check available slots, and book an appointment, with the system making sure no two bookings overlap. Doctors can also see a list of their patients for a particular date.
                    The project is built in Java with a simple text-based interface that runs in the terminal. The app's logic is controlled by a menu, and data is temporarily stored in memory using HashMaps and ArrayLists,
                    without saving to a database. User actions are managed by basic if-else statements, based on what the user selects from the menu.
